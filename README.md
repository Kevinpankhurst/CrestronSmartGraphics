CrestronSmartGraphics
=====================

public repository for Crestron Smart Objects.
Repository under construction and quite empty ATM, the idea is that I'll be posting and updating all my experiments here rather than USB stick-lose everything all the time.
Plan is to have a working repo by November 2014.
