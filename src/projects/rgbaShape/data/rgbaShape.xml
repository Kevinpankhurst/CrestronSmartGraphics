	<!-- 
		TargetControl:
			If using an RSL (see tags above) the TargetControl tells the compiler what class name to instantiate.
			If not using an RSL, this will point to the SWF file to be instantiated.

				This set of properties contains the Width, Height, Top (Y), Left (X), ScaleX, and ScaleY properties.
				When an object is first added to the stage, the Width and Height properties are used as the objects

				acts as a flag for the object to assume its respective styles default size(s).
